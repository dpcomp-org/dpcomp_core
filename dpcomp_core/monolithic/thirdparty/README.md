#Third party code

This directory contains code implemented by authors of original paper which introduced the algorithms. The algorithms have been incorporated into the repo, and the invocation interfaces are same as any other algorithm's. The interfaces are described in `__init__.py` of the current folder.

	Please don't run the code directly but instead call the python invocation indicated in the table below.
